Problem Statement
As a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. We want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

 Thumbs up : Increase the volume.
 Thumbs down : Decrease the volume.
 Left swipe : 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds.
 Right swipe : 'Jump' forward 10 seconds.
 Stop : Pause the movie.
